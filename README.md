# JS-Array-Methods-Practise

Task-1: Write the function camelize(str) that changes dash-separated words like “my-short-string” into camel-cased “myShortString”.
That is: removes all dashes, each word after dash becomes uppercased.
Examples:
camelize("background-color") == 'backgroundColor';
camelize("list-style-image") == 'listStyleImage';
camelize("-webkit-transition") == 'WebkitTransition';


Task-2: Write a function filterRange(arr, a, b) that gets an array arr, looks for elements with values higher or equal to a and lower or equal to b and return a result as an array.
The function should not modify the array. It should return the new array.
For instance:
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
let filtered = filterRange(arr, 1, 4);
alert( filtered ); // 3,1 (matching values)
alert( arr ); // 5,3,8,1 (not modified)


Task-3: Write a function filterRangeInPlace(arr, a, b) that gets an array arr and removes from it all values except those that are between a and b. The test is: a ≤ arr[i] ≤ b.
The function should only modify the array. It should not return anything.
For instance:
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
filterRangeInPlace(arr, 1, 4); // removed the numbers except from 1 to 4
alert( arr ); // [3, 1]
